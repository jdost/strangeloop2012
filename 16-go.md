#Go: Code that grows with grace
##Andrew Gerrand

###Why?
* Needed a language for building servers at google, emphasizing:
    * simplicity
    * ease of use
    * readability
    * comprehensibility
    * efficiency
    * concurrency
    * scale

###What is it?
* Open source (BSD license)
    * Language spec
    * Small runtime (garbage collector, scheduluer, etc)
    * Two compilers (GCC, GCCGO)
    * Batteries included stdlib
    * Tools (build, fetch, doc, profile, format)
    * Documentation

###Interfaces
* io.Writer is a writable stream, so net.Conn is one (so is stdout, probably)
* Structural typing, "as long as a thing looks like another thing"
* net.Conn doesn't reference io.Writer interface, just looks like it

###Goroutines
* Goroutines are lightweight threads, that are managed by the Go runtime.
* To run a funciton in a new goroutine, just put `go` before the function call

###Channels
* Goroutines communicate via channels
* A channel is a typed conduit, like a Unix pipe.
* Channels may be synchronous (unbuffered) or async (buffered)

###Selects
* Select statements are like a switch, but selects over channel operations

net/http package is a production level web server
