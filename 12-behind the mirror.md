Usability tests are incredibly beneficial

People were too busy to care about over complication

Most effort is in memory of the architecture

Used project explorer + editor + debugger, which hasn't changed much in past 40
years, major innovations were never mainstream, too reliant on languages or other
ideas

Real ability of programmers is not memory but to abstract from ideas (Credits
clojure for helping come to this idea), the ability to black box things then leave
it alone

Bugs come from inability to immediately question something (have to wait until the
stuff is complete before you can run and see if it works)

REPL is important to do the immediate testing and fix things

Light Table - Abstraction + Connection (black box and get immediate feedback)
