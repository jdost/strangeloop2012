#Visible Programming
##Bret Victor

Environments are better because they have "better programming productivity", implies
the issue with programming is the speed

Programming environments should allow the programmer to see and understand what the
program is doing

1. Read the vocabulary
    Should be able to read the code
1. Follow the flow
    See what is happening, and when
1. See the state
1. Create by reacting
    React to iterations and construct progressively
1. Create by abstracting

###Read the Vocabulary
* Make meaning transparent
* Be able to understand what the code is saying
    ` ellipse(a, b, c, d); // what are a, b, c, and d ?`
* Explain in context

###Follow the Flow
* Need to imply how to get from A to B
* Make flow tangible & visible
    ex. a slider that shows the steps and progress through the program
* Make Time tangible & visible
    ex. a timeline showing the state of each step of execution
* Incorporate UI controls to give more control over the execution, more feedback

###See the State
* Why do we need to recalculate values the computer has already calculated
    ex. loop that requires people think of the math after a computer has computed it
* Show the data
* Show comparisons
    ex. show what each step produces/changes
* Eliminate hidden state

###Create by Reacting
* "Live coding" produces effect only after a whole line of code is written
* Get something on the screen as soon as possible
* Give completions with some arguments already set, lets you adjust
* Dump the parts bucket onto the floor
    ex. gives a selection of all possible commands and compose via mouse clicks

###Create by Abstracting
* Start with one, then make many
* Create your base, move to variables, abstract into a function
* Start concrete, then generalize

See and understand what the program is doing
