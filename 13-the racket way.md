#The Racket Way
##Matthew Flatt

###Racket
* Dialect of Lisp and descendent of Scheme
* Optimizing bytecode+JIT compiler
* Command line tools (DrRacket)
    * Neat REPL inside libraries
* Batteries included (like Python)

Programmers want to do things programmatically (not clicking and typing)

###The Racket Way
* Everything is a program
* Concepts are programming language constructs
* The programming language is extensible

Uses racket to create a document, add functions into document, and merge other
libraries into use

Programming languages should handle processes

Uses racket to customize the output color for stdout and stderr

Racket can control namespacing for events, memory usage

Racket has a **lot** of DSLs to expand use of the language for various things, like
word processing (scribble), roman numerals, etc.  (http/bsl -> beginner student
language, makes (1 + 2) work as (+ 1 2))
